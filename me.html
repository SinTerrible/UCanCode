<p><h2 style="font-family: times-new-roman">Hi, I'm SinTerrible and I go to school. On the weekends I like to post on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-TpCxBND704ijDn8FXbtBQ">my yt</a>
and make websites like this. On weekdays I go to school. School is very fun... especially during Robotics in the afternoons. I like to help other people
  not only in coding but with stressful things in general. I created this website for anybody struggling to comprehend Youtube videos attempting to teach the HTML coding language. Hope this helps!</h2></p>
