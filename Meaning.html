  <h2>Lesson 1: The Meaning and Use of HTML</h2>
  <hr></hr>
  <p> <h3>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is the coding language mainly used to create the structures of websites, web pages, and blogs 
    which is why it has specific commands made for adding headings, text, pictures, and hyperlinks. HTML is not as interactive as Javascript, not as 
    proficient in AI development and programming as Python, and cannot polish a site as well as CSS, it is still key to website building, especially for beginners.
    Although it is very basic, many websites today still use it because it is an easier way to start a foundation. </h3><p>
