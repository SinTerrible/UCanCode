    Otherwise, it would just be a regular document.</h3>
    <p><h3>Let's learn about how to write tags in HTML. These tags are what
      cause the code to show up on your website. Each command begins with an opening tag for example: <(opening tag)> and a closing tag for example: < / (closing tag) ></h3></p>
  <h3><p>Notice how the closing tag has a forward slash right in front of the tag command. If you don't have it, the code will not sense
    a closing tag and the rest of your page will be affected by the command of the opening tag. For example, if you put an opening bold text tag, but do not use a closing one
    somewhere where you want to stop the bolding, the rest of your text in the code will be bolded. Usually, though, your HTML software will automatically add a closing
