  <h1> UCanCode Lessons: The Perfect Way to Begin your HTML Journey </h1>
  <h2>Lesson 2: How to set up and format your code</h2>
  <hr></hr>
  <p> <h3>Let's talk about where you should start coding. There are many free HTML platforms on the internet such as VisualStudioCode, Notepad++,
    and Sublime Text. If you are on Mac, you can even open up TextEdit, but make sure to go to Format->Make Plain Text and name your file index.html. 
    Otherwise, it would just be a regular document.</h3>
    <p><h3>Let's learn about how to write tags in HTML. These tags are what
      cause the code to show up on your website. Each tag begins with an opening tag for example: <(opening tag)> and a closing tag for example: < / (closing tag) ></h3></p>
  <h3><p>Notice how the closing tag has a forward slash right in front of the tag command. If you don't have it, the code will not sense
    a closing tag and the rest of your page will be affected by the opening tag. Your text or message will go in between the tags. </p></h3>
